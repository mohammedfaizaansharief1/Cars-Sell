# Bootstrap 5 UI Exploration & Page Design

## 📝 Project Reflection Report

### ✅ How I Completed the Project
1. I explored the official [Bootstrap 5 Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) and example pages.
2. I identified useful UI components such as Navbar, Cards, Hero Section, and Forms.
3. I created three responsive pages:
   - **Home Page**: Includes a Navbar, Hero section, Feature Cards, and Footer.
   - **About Page**: Contains information about my skills and services.
   - **Contact Page**: Features a working contact form integrated with Formspree.
4. I structured the code cleanly using Bootstrap utility classes and maintained consistent styling.
5. I ensured responsiveness using Bootstrap grid system and utility classes.

### 🛠️ Tools and Resources Used
- Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Formspree for contact form backend
- VS Code for code editing
- Git & GitHub for version control
- GitHub Pages for deployment

I also used **ChatGPT** to get guidance on project structure and sample code snippets.

### ⚡ Challenges Faced and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Ensuring the contact form worked without a custom backend.  
  **Solution**: Used Formspree to handle form submissions.

- **Challenge**: Keeping design consistent across pages.  
  **Solution**: Applied Bootstrap utility classes and created a simple custom CSS file for additional styling.

### 🎓 Learning Journey
This task helped me gain hands-on experience working with Bootstrap 5 components and responsive web design principles. I learned how to remix components creatively instead of copying example pages directly. I now better understand structuring clean HTML projects and deploying them online.
